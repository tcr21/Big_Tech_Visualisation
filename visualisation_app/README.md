## Setup first time running the app
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, it can be downloaded here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install frontend dependencies by running 'npm install' in the 'frontend' directory

## How to run the app once you're set up
- Run 'npm run build' in the frontend directory.
- Run 'npm start' in the frontend directory (i.e. 'visualisation_app/frontend'). This will run both the Flask backend and the React frontend concurrently
